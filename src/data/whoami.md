# About me
My name is Jing Gu.
I am a senior developer, specializing in Angular projects.

I live in Montreal, Canada.

I love food, traveling and component-based object-oriented programming.

### What I do mostly:
- Work on front-end architecture and REST API communication with the Back-end (Python, Django)
- Create reusable component-based UI elements

### What I have done or contributed:
- Developed an Angular UI library (lead)
- Developed an Angular web app that manages audits for auditors and inspectors (lead)
- Developed an Angular web app that promotes cognitive health to reduce the Alzheimer risk (team)
- Developed an Ionic hybrid mobile app that provides a variety of games for school and childcare workers (team)

### My daily tech stack includes:
- Angular
- TypeScript
- RxJs
- TailwindCSS
- SASS
- Ionic
- Contentful CMS
- Astro
- Git and Github

### Other experience:
- Node, MEAN stack
- React
- Gatsby
- Storybook

### What I like:
I love using **Figma** for the app mockups, and **draw.io** for the diagrams.

I have a penchant for documenting things and depending on the purpose or scale, I'll use **Gitbook**, **Docusaurua**, or just **Notion**.

I use **Ubuntu** and am comfortable with any Linux or Mac OS.

I like IT fictions, and I believe all software developers should read this one: **The Phoenix Project** by Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin Behr.

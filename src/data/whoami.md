# About me
I work full-time as a front-end developer, specializing in Angular projects.

### What I do mostly:
- Work on front-end architecture and REST API communication with the Back-end (Python, Django)
- Create reusable component-based UI elements

### My daily tech stack includes:
- Angular
- TypeScript
- RxJs
- TailwindCSS
- SASS
- Ionic
- Contentful CMS
- Astro
- Git and Github

### Other experience:
- Node, MEAN stack
- React
- Gatsby
- Storybook

### What I like using:
I love using **Figma** for the app mockups, and **draw.io** for the diagrams. I have a penchant for documenting things and depending on the purpose or scale, I'll use **Gitbook**, **Docusaurua**, or just **Notion**.

I use **Ubuntu** and am comfortable with any Linux or Mac OS.

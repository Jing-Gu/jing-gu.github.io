Babbling is a cute feature from the littles, but I guess the first or the first few real words must sound very rewarding for any parent. Around 18 month's old, my girl started using real meaningful words to express herself.

Apple. That's all she said, simple, crisp, out of nowhere, with good and lovely pronunciation. That moment made my day.

Facing a bell pepper, she thought that’s also an apple, well there might be some similarity.

“No, that’s not an apple. It’s a Bell Pepper, a Pepper.”

“Pepo.” I got this, after many corrections from a false apple.

She was pretty sure of the banana.

“Anna.”

I still couldn’t fix this.

I started introducing plant milk besides the cow milk.

“You wanna some milk?”

“Almond.” Oh fancy, you’re a big girl now, another precise word, even though she couldn’t tell the difference between almond or soy milk yet.

Other words were hit or miss, such as orange, open.

She could say “Hi” and “Bye” pretty good.

But after going to the day care for one week, she definitely became more naughty, as I just always heard: No, Oh No, No-no-no-no-no...

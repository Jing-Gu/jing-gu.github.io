## What is Pakupack

Pakupack is a static site built with Astro. I wanted a checklist tool that can help the travelers. The main purpose of this website is simple and straight: check or uncheck the travelerâ€™s list.

## What does it do

There are all different types of lists depending on travel purposes, such as road trip, beach vacation etc. To make the packing easier, just choose the correct travel type to go through all the necessary items.

Another option is to hit each checklist one by one by category, such as essentials, health, electronics etc.

Making this light weight website was also a chance to explore the possibility between Astro and Tailwind.
